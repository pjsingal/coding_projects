  <h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
  <p>I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Canada. A key interest of mine is designing products and systems that address environmental and other global issues. With this motivation, I founded (and currently manage) the Queen&#x27;s Vertical Farming Team, which aims to grow the food of the future by designing an automated aeroponic cultivation system. I also co-designed a low-cost COVID-19 ventilator, which ranked in the top 65 of 1,029 international submissions at the 2020 Code Life Ventilator Challenge. </p>
  <p>I work as an investment associate at Front Row Ventures, Canadaâ€™s largest student venture capital fund. This firm collectively controls &gt;$800K in investible funds and administers $25K cheque sizes to student-founded technology start-ups. Being part of this organization has provided a wealth of knowledge that was not directly available through my engineering education.</p>
  <p>I conduct research with the Rival Lab at Queen&#x27;s University, which focuses on bio-inspired experimental fluid dynamics. My first project was designing a complex CAD model of an airfoil, which contains an embedded network of pressure-measurement channels, taps, and transducer ports that are geometrically optimized to reduce noise and signal error. Currently, I am assisting with running towing tank experiments on airfoils across a range of boundary conditions to collect data for training a predictive algorithm for sparse pressure data in gusty, turbulent flows.</p>
  <p>For my capstone project, I am involved in a year-long industry partnership with a manufacturer of heavy-duty electric vehicles. Our team is designing an optimized thermal management system that minimizes redundancy while maintaining the sensitive operating temperatures of Li-ion batteries, motors, and auxiliary components. We validate this design using multi-objective optimization techniques, which are computed using simulations and numerical models that we have developed. I am also completing an undergraduate thesis that involves using ANSYS Fluent to simulate turbulent, compressible flow through a rotating detonation engine fuel supply valve.</p>
  <p>Further information about these projects and other experiences is available in my CV and project summary. I am always looking to connect with like-minded people and exchange ideas. Please feel free to reach out!</p>
